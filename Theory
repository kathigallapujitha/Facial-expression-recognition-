EmotionSense – Facial Expression Recognition using Deep Learning

📌 Project Overview

EmotionSense is an AI-driven facial expression recognition system that predicts human emotions from images. When a user uploads a photo, the model detects the face and classifies expressions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprise, Fear, and Disgust.
This project combines Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to analyze facial features and deliver accurate emotion predictions.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV – for face detection and image preprocessing

TensorFlow / Keras – for CNN-based emotion classification

FER Library – for pretrained emotion detection

NumPy & Matplotlib – image handling and visualization

Google Colab – model execution and testing

⚙️ How the System Works

1. Image Upload
The user provides an input image containing a human face.


2. Face Detection
Using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade/MTCNN, the system detects and extracts facial regions from the image.


3. Image Preprocessing

Convert to grayscale or RGB

Resize to required model input dimensions

Normalize pixel values



4. Emotion Classification
A CNN or pretrained FER model analyzes facial landmarks and predicts the emotion with confidence scores.


5. Output Generation

Displays the detected face

Shows the predicted emotion label

Provides probability distribution for all emotions
